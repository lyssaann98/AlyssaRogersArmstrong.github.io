									<h1>About Me<br />
								</header>
								<center>My name is Alyssa Rogers-Armstrong and I am currently a 7th grade mathematics teacher, math department chair, and team lead. After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh during the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, I was accepted into the prestigious corps program, Teach for America, which has an acceptance rate of 11-15%. Teach for America is a nonprofit organization that chooses promising leaders to grow and strengthen the movement for educational equity in underserved communities. I was placed in the D.C. metro area and have been teaching in Alexandria City Public Schools in Virginia for the past three years.</center> <br />
									<br />
									<center>Throughout my time in the corps, I have re-found my love for mathematics and further developed my passion for data and business analytics. I started out by completing a Data Analytics Certification Course from Google and used those skills to analyze my classroom student data to improve test scores and student engagement. More recently, I was accepted into Virginia Tech's Data Analysis and Applied Statistics master's program and will graduate in May 2025. I have taken a number of classes so far, including, Introduction to Statistical Computing, Statistics in Research, Communication in Statistics, Advanced Methods of Regression, Data Analytics, Experimental Design, and Statistical Computing for Data Analytics.</center> <br />
									<br />
										<center>While being a full-time teacher, I am constantly learning new skills and refining the ones I have already learned to better prepare me for an analyst position in the near future.</center> <br />
